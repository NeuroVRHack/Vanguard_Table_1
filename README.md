## Description
  The VR classroom project aims to create a virtual reality (VR) environment for education. It involves building detailed 3D classrooms where
  students can engage with lifelike settings using VR headsets. Key features include immersive experiences, interactive tools like virtual
  objects that are related to the subject, remote learning capabilities, customization options for educators, and assessment tools to track
  student progress. Additionally, the project incorporates space learning principles by providing students with virtual environments that
  simulate real-world spaces, fostering spatial awareness and understanding. Furthermore, brain learning components are integrated to
  optimize learning processes based on neuroscience principles, enhancing cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and problem-solving.
  Ultimately, the project seeks to revolutionize education by offering engaging, technology-driven learning experiences that encourage
  participation, collaboration, and cognitive development.
